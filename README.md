### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Over decades, linguists have shown that language form and language in context could be different in people with different background. Today, I conduct data analysis on HappyDB to explore the variation of written text. HappyDB is a corpus of 100,000 crowd-sourced happy moments which people shared in the past three months or past 24 hours (https://rit-public.github.io/HappyDB/ ). In this study, I would like to investigate how the happy moments change among people in different countries with different age and different marital status.

Term: Fall 2018

+ Projec title:  Data Analysis in Happy Moments corpus
+ This project is conducted by [Hongyu Ji]

+ Project summary: [a short summary] Length and Topics are the main keys in a sentence, therefore I use exploratory data analysis (boxplot, line plot, and scatterplot), word clouds, bigrams and topic modeling to analyze on the two aspects.
